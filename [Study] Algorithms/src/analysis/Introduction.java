	 * WHY ANALYSE ALGORITHMS
	 * ----------------------
	 * 
	 * -> Predict performance
	 * -> Provide guarantees
	 * -> Compare algorithms
	 * -> Understand theoretical basis
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Examples of algorithmic success
	 * 
	 * # Discrete Fourier Transform :: break down waveform of N samples into periodic components
	 *                              :: N*logN algorithm
	 *                              :: applications -> DVD, JPEG, etc.
	 *                              
	 * # N-body Simulation :: simulate gravitational interactions between N bodies
	 * 					   :: N*logN algorithm
	 *                     :: applications -> new research

	 * SCIENTIFIC METHOD
	 * -----------------
	 * 
	 * FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING PERFORMANCE AND COMPARING ALGORITHMS:
	 * 1. OBSERVE feature of natural world
	 * 2. HYPOTHESIZE model consistent with observations
	 * 3. PREDICT events using the hypothesis
	 * 4. VERIFY predictions
	 * 5. VALIDATE by repeating until the hypothesis and the observations agree
